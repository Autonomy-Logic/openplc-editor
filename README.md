### Workflow guides

> 1.**Whenever you are going to develop a new functionality or fix, go to the branch _main_ and do a pull _(git pull)_ <br>
> to ensure that your version of code is up to date with regard to the Github repository, avoiding conflicts.**
>
> 2.**When developing a feature, make a branch for it.<br>
> Except in exceptional cases, avoid pushing directly to the _main_ branch.**
>
> 3.**Do periodic commits; don't wait until you've completed the task to do it.<br>
> This may make code rastreability difficult.**

### Naming Conventions :

> For branch names, use the group name in uppercase, followed by the branch's purpose in lowercase, and a hyphen as a separator.
>
> > Examples:
> >
> > > BUG-first-deployment-issues<br>
> > > FEAT-header-component
>
> Groups of branches:
>
> > BUG - A problem in the development environment;<br>
> > HOTFIX - A problem that has arisen in the production environment;<br>
> > FEATURE - A new feature that has been approved and is fully ready for development;<br>
> > WIP - A newly approved feature that is dependent on other functionality but is ready for development.
>
> Use camelCase for files:
>
> > Example:
> >
> > > homePage.tsx
>
> PascalCase should be used for components:
>
> > Example:
> >
> > > HomePage()
>
> Other naming conventions include camelCase for variables, constants, functions, and methods, and PascalCase for classes.
